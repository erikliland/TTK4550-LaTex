\subsection{A brief history of tracking}

You want to know where you are. Latitude is easy to determine with a sextant, with e.g. the North star or the sun at its highest point. By keeping the home port time with a clock onboard, and measuring time where you are, you can estimate longitude. But clocks (or ``marine chronometers'' if you're a huge nerd) were too inaccurate until John Harrison made a really nice one in the 18th century. Some guys also computed time by observing the moons of Saturn.
