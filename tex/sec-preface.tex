\section*{Preface}
The work presented in this report is the result of a term project, TTK4550 Engineering cybernetics specialization report, at \gls{ntnu}. The aim is to \emph{let the student specialize in a selected area based on scientific methods, collect supplementary information based on literature search and other sources and combine this with own knowledge into a project report}\footnote{http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4550}. The learning outcome of this project is to give the student an extensive knowledge in a current problem, good knowledge in related topics and relevant scientific literature.

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Edmund F. Brekke and advisor Ph.D. Candidate Erik Wilthil for their time, feedback and interesting discussions during this work.
