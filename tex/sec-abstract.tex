An \gls{asv} is an unmanned vessels which can for instance be used to transport cargo and people as well as for surveillance and other tasks. To ensure a safe journey, the route planer needs a real time image of its surroundings in addition to map data to avoid collision and dangerous situations with other vessels. In the maritime environment, this is primarily done by \glspl{radar} mounted on the ship itself. 

A key challenge in radar tracking is to know which \gls{measurement} belongs together from \gls{scan} to \gls{scan} to get a \gls{track} on each target. \gls{mht} has become the preferred method for solving the data association problem in a multi-target environment. In a maritime tracking situation for anti collision, \gls{mht} demonstrates its reliability for use in safety critical systems since it compensates for missed detections by utilizing multiple \glspl{scan} in the association. 

The problem of selecting the optimal assignment of \glspl{track hypothesis} in a \gls{tomht} is discussed and applied to off-the-shelf \gls{ilp} solvers. This report shows that a \gls{tomht} successfully \gls{track} targets with detection probability above $70\%$ with less than $5\%$ average \gls{track} loss in multi-target scenarios with clutter.

It also discusses the computational cost of \gls{mht} and shows the feasibility for \gls{mht} implemented on modest personal computer and potential for paralleling on high end real time systems.
