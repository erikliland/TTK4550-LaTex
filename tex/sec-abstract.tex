\section*{Abstract}
A key challenge in radar tracking is to know which \gls{measurement} belongs together from \gls{scan} to \gls{scan}, to get a \gls{track} on each target. \gls{mht} has become the preferred method for solving the data association problem in a multi-target environment. In a maritime tracking situation for anti collision, \gls{mht} demonstrates its reliability for use in safety critical systems since it compensates for missed detections by utilizing multiple \glspl{scan} in the association. 

The problem of selecting the optimal assignment of \glspl{track hypothesis} in a \gls{tomht} is discussed and solved by means of off-the-shelf \gls{ilp} solvers. This report shows that a \gls{tomht} successfully \gls{track} targets with detection probability above $70\%$ with less than $5\%$ average \gls{track} loss in multi-target scenarios with clutter.

The computational cost of \gls{mht} and feasibility for \gls{mht} implementation on a modest personal computer and potential for parallelization on high end real time systems are also discussed.
