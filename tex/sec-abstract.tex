Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) are, at least in control and navigational perspective, unmanned vessels which can for instance be used to transport cargo and people as well as for surveillance and other tasks. To ensure a safe journey, the route planer needs a real time image of its surroundings in addition to map data to avoid collision and dangerous situations with other vessels. In the maritime environment, this is primarily done by radars mounted on the ship itself, were the challenge is to know which measurement (reflection) belongs together from scan to scan to get a track on each target.

Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) has become the preferred method for solving the data association problem in a multi target environment. In a maritime tracking situation for anti collision, MHT demonstrates it reliability for use in safety critical systems since it avoids track coalescence and compensate for missed detections by utilizing multiple scans. This report shows that a Track Oriented MHT (TO-MHT) successfully track targets with detection probability above $70\%$ with less than $5\%$ average track loss in multi target scenarios with clutter.

It also discusses the computational cost of MHT and shows the feasibility for MHT implemented on modest personal computer and potential for paralleling on high end real time systems.
