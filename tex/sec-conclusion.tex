\section{Closing remarks}
\subsection{Conclusion}
This report has shown that off-the-shelf integer linear program (ILP) solvers, both free and commercial, are capable solving the data association problem in a track oriented multiple hypothesis tracker. It has also shown that the tracking performance does benefit very little from more than $N=3$ scan history when the probability of detection $P_D > 70\%$, even with severe amounts of clutter.

\subsection{Future work}
Pruning / merge similar state

Prune unlikely hypothesis as long as the problem is still solvable

Parallelization / scaling

Use AIS to aid tracking

\subsubsection{Track initialization}
- Recursive ransac

- PDA

- Another MHT
