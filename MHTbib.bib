abstract = {This paper considers the problem of joint maneuvering target tracking and classification. Based on recently proposed Monte Carlo techniques, a multiple model (MM) particle filter and a mixture Kalman filter (MKF) are designed for two-class identification of air targets: commercial and military aircraft. The classification task is carried out by processing radar measurements only, no class (feature) measurements are used. A speed likelihood function for each class is defined using a prior information about speed constraints. Class-dependent speed likelihoods are calculated through the state estimates of each class-dependent tracker. They are combined with the kinematic measurement likelihoods in order to improve the classification process. The two designed estimators are compared and evaluated over rather complex target scenarios. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme for the incorporation of additional speed information. Both filters illustrate the opportunity of the particle filtering and mixture Kalman filtering to incorporate constraints in a natural way, providing reliable tracking and correct classification. Future observations contain valuable information about the current state of the dynamic systems. In the framework of the MKF, an algorithm for delayed estimation is designed for improving the current modal state estimate. It is used as an additional, more reliable information in resolving complicated classification situations. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper discusses several theoretical issues related to the score function for the measurement-to-track association/assignment decision in the track-oriented version of the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT). This score function is the likelihood ratio: the ratio of the probability density function (pdf) of a measurement having originated from a track, to the pdf of this measurement having a different origin. The likelihood ratio score is derived rigorously starting from the fully Bayesian MHT (hypothesis oriented, based on combinatorial analysis of the general multitarget problem), which is shown to be amenable under some (reasonable) assumptions to the track-oriented MHT (TOMHT). The latter can be implemented efficiently using multidimensional assignment (MDA). The main feature of a likelihood ratio is the fact that it is a (physically) dimensionless quantity and, consequently, can be used for the association of different numbers of measurements and/or measurements of different dimension. The explicit forms of the likelihood ratio are discussed both for the commonly used Kalman tracking filter, as well as for the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator. The issues of measurements of different dimension and different coordinate systems together with the selection of certain MHT design parameters - the spatial densities of the false measurements and new targets - are also discussed},

abstract = {Traditionally, the literature on target tracking assumes that the targets of interest are em- bedded in homogenous Rayleigh distributed background noise. It is most often assumed that purely kinematic point measurements are extracted from the sensor images, so that the tracking problem can be phrased in terms of data association. The tracker has to de- cide which point measurements are likely to have been caused by the target, and update the track correspondingly. All other measurements are discarded as clutter. This thesis concerns clutter which does not conform to this framework. The follow- ing three challenges are addressed: dim targets, heavy-tailed clutter and wakes. For very dim targets it is impossible to extract point measurements, and tracking can only be done by working directly on the raw sensor images. Several methods for such track-before-detect can be found in the literature. In recent years methods based on sequential Monte Carlo have gained strong popularity. This thesis demonstrates that such methods cannot be expected to perform well unless the amplitudes of sensor cells are treated in a robustway. More precisely, it is demonstrated that a satisfactory performance only can be achieved when the uncertainty of the background noise estimate is taken into account. This is done by means of marginalization over a flat prior distribution for the unknown background power. Similar issues arise in the treatment of heavy-tailed clutter. A heavy-tailed back- ground is a background which generates more frequent occurrences of target-like out- liers than what one would expect under the Rayleigh assumption. In other words, more false alarms must be accepted if we shall have any hope of detecting the target, and this causes an inevitable degradation of performance. This thesis presents the first systematic study of this performance loss from a target tracking point of view. It is demonstrated that the performance loss may be substantially mitigated by usage amplitude informa- tion, depending on how this information is treated},

We then introduce a method, referred to as joint tracking and$\backslash$nclassification (JTC), for treating target tracking and classification$\backslash$nproblems jointly, by exploiting the dependence of target class on target$\backslash$nstate via flight-envelope-dependent classes and the dependence of target$\backslash$nstate on target class via class dependent kinematic models.

The probabilistic data association (PDA) method, which is based on computing the posterior probability of each candidate measurement found in a validation gate, assumes that only one real target is present and all other measurements are Poisson-distributed clutter. In this paper, a new theoretical result is presented: the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, in which joint posterior association probabilities are computed for multiple targets (or multiple discrete interfering sources) in Poisson clutter. The algorithm is applied to a passive sonar tracking problem with multiple sensors and targets, in which a target is not fully observable from a single sensor. Targets are modeled with four geographic states, two or more acoustic states, and realistic (i.e., low) probabilities of detection at each sample time. A simulation result is presented for two heavily interfering targets illustrating the dramatic tracking improvements obtained by estimating the targets' states using joint association probabilities.},

abstract = {In maritime surveillance, messages from radar and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers are used for vessel trafficking and monitoring. The common trend is to use radars as the primary source of surveillance and AIS as a secondary source with little interaction between these data sets. The AIS messages provide very accurate position estimates associated with ID and other vessel information. However, AIS messages arrive unpredictably and intermittently depending on the type and behavior of the vessel. In addition, the revisit interval of AIS messages could be very large and it may vary from one vessel to another. In this work, a new measurement-level fusion algorithm to combine radar and AIS messages is proposed using the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) framework. The proposed method handles AIS ID swaps between vessels and missing IDs while effectively fusing the radar measurements with AIS messages at measurement level. The uncertainty in the AIS ID-to-track assignment is resolved by assigning multiple AIS IDs to a target and updating the ID probabilities using a Bayesian inference with radar measurements, AIS messages and other targets. The performance of the proposed measurement-level fusion is compared with that of the track-to-track fusion. A modified Posterior Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) is also derived for the variable-rate heterogenous AIS/Radar network. Experimental results based on simulated data demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been achieved in recent years with respect to autonomous vehicles. A good example is the DARPA Grand Challenge, a competition for autonomous ground vehicles. None of the competing vehicles managed to complete the challenge in 2004, but returning in 2005, a total of five vehicles were successful. Effective collision avoidance is a requirement for autonomous navigation, and even though much progress has been done, it still remains an open problem. The focus of this thesis is on the development of a collision avoidance system for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which is compliant with the International Regula- tions for Avoiding Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). The system is based on a modified version of the Dynamic Window algorithm, taking both acceleration and lateral speeds into account for reactive collision avoidance. Path planning is provided by the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, extended to use the A* algorithm as a guide, which significantly increases its efficiency. Extensive simulations have been performed in order to determine the value of the mod- ifications done to the original algorithms, as well as the performance of the total control system. Full-scale experiments have also been carried out in an attempt to verify the results from the simulations. The collision avoidance system performed very well during the simulations, finding near-optimal paths through the environment and evading other vessels in a COLREGS-compliant fashion. In the full-scale experiments, important sen- sor data was erroneous, resulting in reduced avoidance margins. However, the collision avoidance system still kept the controlled vessel safe, showing significant robustness.},

abstract = {The NUTS (NTNU Test Satellite) is a satellite being built as a student CubeSat project. The project started in September 2010 as a part of the Norwegian student satellite program run by NAROM (Nor-wegian Centre for Space-related Education). The NUTS project goals are to design, manufacture and launch a double CubeSat by 2014. Using solar panels on 5 of 6 sides of the NUTS CubeSat, we have a lot of attitude determinating informa-tion readily available during much of the periodical orbit. Using three or more solar panels in combination can trigonometrically produce a sun vector. However, treating all inbound sunlight as direct light from the sun leaves the result vulnerable to disturbances like the Earth albedo effect (reflected sunlight from the Earth), which is hard to model and computationally expensive to simulate. Not compensating for this effect can corrupt or introduce large offsets in computed sun vectors. Treating the output current from the solar panels as an angle of 3D inbound light towards the 2D plane of the panel can produce a set of independent mathematical conical shells. Given the cubic shape of the satellite, these independent conical shells can iteratively be combined into sets of two and two or-thogonal conical shells which will produce intersection curves with eachother if the angle of aperture is large enough. Even though the panels are physically spaced apart, it can be shown that without loss of generality, these conical shells can be translated along their respective axis of the satellite BODY frame to have overlapping origins, which we can use to map the convergences of the parabolic intersection curves into two possible inbound sun vectors for each pair of solar panels. Knowing that opposing panels can't be combined to yield valid information, our 5 sides of panels can be combined into 8 different pairs from which we can interpret information. At the time of writing, MATLAB code to display computed sun vectors from conical shell intersections produced by sets of panels in real time has been made and physical experiments are about to commence. Algorithms to compare and evaluate the produced cluster of vectors to extract desired information and suppress disturbance are in the making. Making use of instantaneous and tracked individual vectorial attitudes as well as their rates of change seems promising, but special attention needs to be paid to the Earth albedo effect in attempt to identify and suppress this disturbance.},

abstract = {An algorithm for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered environment is developed. The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis, using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently. In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.},

abstract = {In this work we present a linear programming (LP) based approach for solving the data association problem (DAP) in multiple target tracking. It is well-known that the DAP can be formulated as an integer program. We present a compact formulation of the DAP. To solve practical instances of the DAP we propose an algorithm that uses an iterated K-scan sliding window technique. In each iteration we solve the LP relaxation of an integer program and next apply a greedy rounding procedure. Computational experiments indicate that the quality of the solutions found is quite satisfactory. The purpose of this article is to present an alternative approach to solving data association problems that arise from multitarget tracking. As a starting point we use the work reported by Poore et al. (Comput. Optim. Appl. 3 (1994) 27; SPIE 1954 (1993) 552) in which the data association problem is viewed as a multidimensional assignment problem. Instead of using Lagrangian relaxation techniques (SIAM J. Optim. 3 (1993) 554; SPIE 1955 (1993) 172; SPIE 1954 (1993) 564; SPIE 2561 (1995) 448), we apply linear programming (LP) relaxation. A feasible solution is constructed from the relaxed solution by a new heuristic greedy rounding procedure called GRP. The choice for a heuristic approach is justified by the hard real-time requirements that are inherent to multitarget tracking. The application of the GRP lies mainly within the field of (air) surveillance systems for both the military and the civilian domain. Although the focus of this paper is on single sensor systems (i.e. a surveillance radar), the scope can be extended to sensor data fusion systems in which multiple (dissimilar) sensors are involved. More generally, real-time algorithms that provide good-quality solutions for multidimensional assignment problems have a broad scope of applications in the field of robotics (e.g. planning of robot arm movement), communications and the military domain (e.g. weapon assignment, sensor resource allocation, etc.). ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
